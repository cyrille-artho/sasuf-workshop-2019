**Willem Visser (University of Stellenbosch): Searching Fast and Slow: Fuzzing and Symbolic Execution**
  </summary>
Abstract: </br>
The past few years a number of research groups built tools where they combined fuzzing and symbolic execution, and in this talk we will discuss yet another case. The combination of these two technologies for bug finding is a no-brainer: fuzzing covers lots of cases with very little effort, but can get stuck generating inputs to highly constrained behaviours, for which symbolic execution is good. What makes our approach (COASTAL) somewhat unique is that it uses concolic execution rather than classic symbolic execution and that the fuzzer and the concolic execution were built into the same framework, from scratch (in other words it is not two existing tools that are being combined). In this talk we will discuss the design decisions, the integrated architecture and show some examples.
